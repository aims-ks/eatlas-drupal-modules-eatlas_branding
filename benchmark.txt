NOTE:
In order to get the readings, I hacked the module views:

function views_page($name, $display_id) {
  $__starts = microtime(true);
  $args = func_get_args();
  // Remove $name and $display_id from the arguments.
  array_shift($args);
  array_shift($args);

  // Load the view and render it.
  if ($view = views_get_view($name)) {
    $output = $view->execute_display($display_id, $args);
    $__time = number_format(microtime(true) - $__starts, 8);
    print "Execution time: $__time sec.";
    return $output;
  }

  // Fallback; if we get here no view was found or handler was not valid.
  return MENU_NOT_FOUND;
}


NOTE:
EntityFieldQuery is supposed to be much more efficient, but it still
load the body and other default fields that I don't need, and it has to
filter out the custom fields I don't need when loading the node from
the cache. Also, I can't find out how to get the "book" field for book
nodes. Overall, "node_load" is better. The initialisation time is the
worst but the normal load time is 3 times faster than "EntityFieldQuery".

function _eatlas_branding_load_node_array_from_id($nid) {
	$query = new EntityFieldQuery();
	$query->entityCondition('entity_type', 'node')
		->propertyCondition('nid', $nid);
	$result = $query->execute();

	if (isset($result['node'][$nid])) {
		$raw_node = $result['node'];

		// Load the field ID
		$field_branding_info = field_info_field(EATLAS_BRANDING_FIELD_BRANDING);
		if (isset($field_branding_info['id'])) {
			// Attach a field to get value for it
			field_attach_load('node', $raw_node, FIELD_LOAD_CURRENT, array('field_id' => $field_branding_info['id']));
		}

		$field_supported_brandings_info = field_info_field(EATLAS_BRANDING_FIELD_SUPPORTED_BRANDINGS);
		if (isset($field_supported_brandings_info['id'])) {
			field_attach_load('node', $raw_node, FIELD_LOAD_CURRENT, array('field_id' => $field_supported_brandings_info['id']));
		}

		return __eatlas_branding_obj_to_array($raw_node[$nid]);
	}
	return NULL;
}
